# MixPanel Xamarin Binding

This is a first pass, kinda just working (ie: untested) Xamarin binding for MixPanel on iOS.

To build (you'll need xcode and Xamarin Studio installed), clone this repo and then:

	> cd mixpanel-iphone-xamarin
	> git submodule init
	> git submodule update
	> make

Or, there's a pre-cooked MixPanel.dll in the repo root.
